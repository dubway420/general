Engineering safety in machine learning,"Varshney, Kush R.",https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/engineering-safety-machine-learning/,"Machine learning algorithms are increasingly influencing our decisions and interacting with us in all parts of our daily lives. Therefore, just like for power plants, highways, and myriad other engineered sociotechnical systems, we must consider the safety of systems involving machine learning. In this paper, we first discuss the definition of safety in terms of risk, epistemic uncertainty, and the harm incurred by unwanted outcomes. Then we examine dimensions, such as the choice of cost function and the appropriateness of minimizing the empirical average training cost, along which certain real-world applications may not be completely amenable to the foundational principle of modern statistical machine learning: empirical risk minimization. In particular, we note an emerging dichotomy of applications: ones in which safety is important and risk minimization is not the complete story (we name these Type A applications), and ones in which safety is not so critical and risk minimization is sufficient (we name these Type B applications). Finally, we discuss how four different strategies for achieving safety in engineering (inherently safe design, safety reserves, safe fail, and procedural safeguards) can be mapped to the machine learning context through interpretability and causality of predictive models, objectives beyond expected prediction accuracy, human involvement for labeling difficult or rare examples, and user experience design of software.",ML,5,2
Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks,"Ren, Shaoqing
He, Kaiming
Girshick, Ross
Sun, Jian",https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/faster-rcnn-towards-realtime-object-detection-region-proposal-networks/,"State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.",ML,13,4
Feature extraction and sensor selection for NPP initiating event identification,"Lin, Ting-Han
Wu, Shun-Chi
Chen, Kuang-You
Chou, Hwai-Pwu",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306454916309999,"Initiating event identification is essential in managing nuclear power plant (NPP) severe accidents. In this paper, a novel two-stage feature extraction scheme that incorporates the proposed sensor type-wise block projection (stBP) and deflatable sequential forward selection (dSFS) is used to elicit the discriminant information in the data obtained from various NPP sensors to facilitate event identification. With the stBP, the primal features can be extracted without eliminating the interrelations among the sensors of the same type. The extracted features are then subjected to a further dimensionality reduction by selecting the sensors that are most relevant to the events under consideration. This selection is not easy, and a combinatorial optimization technique is normally required. With the dSFS, an optimal sensor set can be found with less computational load. Moreover, its sensor deflation stage allows sensors in the preselected set to be iteratively refined to avoid being trapped into a local optimum. Results from detailed experiments containing data of 12 event categories and a total of 112 events generated with a Taiwan’s Maanshan NPP simulator are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.",Nuclear/ML,9,3
Efficient inference in fully connected crfs with gaussian edge potentials,"Krähenbühl, Philipp
Koltun, Vladlen",https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/efficient-inference-fully-connected-crfs-gaussian-edge-potentials/,"Most state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class image segmentation and labeling use conditional random fields defined over pixels or image regions. While region-level models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy.",ML,9,5
Potential applications of neural networks to nuclear power plants,"Uhrig, ROBERT E",https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/24/033/24033319.pdf?r=1&r=1,"The application of neural networks, a rapidly evolving technology used extensively in defense applications, to some of the problems of operating nuclear power plants is a logical complement to the expert systems currently being introduced in some of those plants. The potential applications of neural networks include, but are not limited to: (1) Diagnosing specific abnormal conditions. (2) Identifying nonlinear dynamics and transients. (3) Detecting the change of mode of operation. (4) Controlling temperature and pressure during start-up. (5) validating signals. (6) Plant-wide monitoring using autoassociative neural networks.

Beyond classification: structured regression for robust cell detection using convolutional neural network,"Xie, Yuanpu
Xing, Fuyong
Kong, Xiangfei
Su, Hai
Yang, Lin",https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/beyond-classification-structured-regression-robust-cell-detection-using-convolutional-neural-network-1/,"Robust cell detection serves as a critical prerequisite for many biomedical image analysis applications. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based structured regression model, which is shown to be able to handle touching cells, inhomogeneous background noises, and large variations in sizes and shapes. The proposed method only requires a few training images with weak annotations (just one click near the center of the object). Given an input image patch, instead of providing a single class label like many traditional methods, our algorithm will generate the structured outputs (referred to as proximity patches). These proximity patches, which exhibit higher values for pixels near cell centers, will then be gathered from all testing image patches and fused to obtain the final proximity map, where the maximum positions indicate the cell centroids. The algorithm is tested using three data sets representing different image stains and modalities. The comparative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of this novel method over existing state-of-the-art.",ML,8,4
Breast cancer detection from FNA using SVM with different parameter tuning systems and SOM--RBF classifier,"Mu, Tingting
Nandi, Asoke K",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003206001293,"In this paper, we consider the benefits of applying support vector machines (SVMs), radial basis function (RBF) networks, and self-organizing maps (SOMs) for breast cancer detection. The Wisconsin diagnosis breast cancer (WDBC) dataset is used in the classification experiments; the dataset was generated from fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples through image processing. The 1-norm C-SVM (-SVM), 2-norm C-SVM (-SVM), and -SVM classifiers are applied, for which the grid search based on span error estimate (GSSEE), gradient descent based on validation error estimate (GDVEE), and gradient descent based on span error estimate (GDSEE) are developed to improve the detection accuracy. The gradient descent (GD) tuning method based on the span error estimate (SEE) is employed for the -SVM classifier because of its reachable smooth nonlinearity. Such a GDSEE tuning system also has the advantage of saving available samples for the training procedure. The SOM–RBF classifier is developed to improve the performance of only the SOM learning procedure based on distance comparison, in which the RBF network is employed to process the clustering result obtained by the SOM. Experimental results demonstrate that SVM classifiers with the proposed automatic parameter tuning systems and the SOM–RBF classifier can be efficient tools for breast cancer detection, with the detection accuracy up to 98.",ML,27,10
Sensor fault detection in nuclear power plants using multivariate state estimation technique and support vector machines,"Zavaljevski, Nela
Gross, Kenny C",https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/sensor-fault-detection-nuclear-power-plants-using-multivariate-state-estimation-technique-support-ve/,"Validation of nuclear power reactor signals is often performed by comparing signal prototypes with the actual reactor signals. The signal prototypes are often computed based on empirical data. The implementation of an estimation algorithm which can make predictions on limited data is an important issue. A new machine learning algorithm called support vector machines (SVMS) recently developed by Vladimir Vapnik and his coworkers enables a high level of generalization with finite high-dimensional data. The improved generalization in comparison with standard methods like neural networks is due mainly to the following characteristics of the method. The input data space is transformed into a high-dimensional feature space using a kernel function, and the learning problem is formulated as a convex quadratic programming problem with a unique solution. In this paper we have applied the SVM method for data-based state estimation in nuclear power reactors. In particular, we implemented and tested kernels developed at Argonne National Laboratory for the Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET), a nonlinear, nonparametric estimation technique with a wide range of applications in nuclear reactors. The methodology has been applied to three data sets from experimental and commercial nuclear power reactor applications. The results are promising. The combination of MSET kernels with the SVM method has better noise reduction and generalization properties than the standard MSET algorithm.",Nuclear/ML,11,8
Unsupervised clustering for fault diagnosis in nuclear power plant components,"Baraldi, Piero
Di Maio, Francesco
Zio, Enrico",https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/unsupervised-clustering-fault-diagnosis-nuclear-power-plant-components/,"The development of empirical classification models for fault diagnosis usually requires a process of training based on a set of examples. In practice, data collected during plant operation contain signals measured in faulty conditions, but they are 'unlabeled', i.e., the indication of the type of fault is usually not available. Then, the objective of the present work is to develop a methodology for the identification of transients of similar characteristics, under the conjecture that faults of the same type lead to similar behavior in the measured signals. The proposed methodology is based on the combined use of Haar wavelet transform, fuzzy similarity, spectral clustering and the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm. A procedure for interpreting the fault cause originating the similar transients is proposed, based on the identification of prototypical behaviors. Its performance is tested with respect to an artificial case study and then applied on transients originated by different faults in the pressurizer of a nuclear power reactor. © 2013 Copyright the authors.",ML/Nuclear,14,7
Soft computing technologies in nuclear engineering applications,"Uhrig, Robert E
Tsoukalas, Lefteri H",https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/soft-computing-technologies-nuclear-engineering-applications/,"The application of soft computing technologies, particularly neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms, to the surveillance, diagnostics and operation of nuclear power plants and their components is an area that has great potential for exploitation. Areas of potential application are to the surveillance and diagnostics of complete nuclear power plants and to specific systems such as check valves, instrumentation systems, and rotating machinery. Applications include sensor surveillance and calibration verification, diagnostics of both plant transients and specific faults, efficiency optimization, vibration analysis, loose parts monitoring, and adaptive and/or optimal control. The synergistic benefits of combining the use of neutral networks, fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms are illustrated in several application. Although some of the work cited (e.g. vibration systems) are not necessarily associated with nuclear power plants, the results are directly applicable. Indeed, the methodologies of soft computing technologies have many applications outside the nuclear power field, e.g., fossil-fired power plants, chemical process facilities, high performance aerospace systems, financial market issues, sociological systems, and others.",CS,63,7
